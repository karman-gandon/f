Greetings, Community!

I'm thrilled to announce the official launch of WebCar UI v1.0, an innovative solution to enhance your in-car multimedia experience.

Key Features:

🎵 An integrated music player with three premium tracks for an elevated audio journey.
🗺️ Built-in maps for seamless, distraction-free navigation.
🎨 Customizable wallpapers to personalize your dashboard to your taste.
Designed for cars without modern multimedia systems, WebCar UI transforms your driving experience with just a tablet running Windows with Chrome and an AUX connection to your car stereo.
